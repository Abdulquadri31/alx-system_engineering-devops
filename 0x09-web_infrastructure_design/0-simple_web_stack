1. User Access

A user wants to visit www.foobar.com using their browser.
Their browser queries the DNS system to resolve www.foobar.com into an IP address.

2. DNS and Domain Name

Domain Name: foobar.com is registered and configured with a DNS record.
www Record: A CNAME (Canonical Name) or A record is set up for www.foobar.com, pointing to the IP address 8.8.8.8 (our server).
DNS Role: It maps the user-friendly domain name (www.foobar.com) to the server’s IP address (8.8.8.8).

3. Server and Web Infrastructure

Server
The server is a physical or virtual machine identified by the IP 8.8.8.8.
It hosts the entire stack required for the website, including:
Web Server (Nginx)
Application Server
Codebase
Database (MySQL)
Web Server (Nginx)
Role: Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from the user’s browser.
It serves static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.
Application Server
Role: Processes the logic of the application.
It runs the codebase, handles user inputs, and communicates with the database for data retrieval or storage.
Database (MySQL)
Role: Stores structured data (e.g., user information, product catalogs).
It responds to queries from the application server to provide the data needed to render web pages dynamically.

4. Communication Flow

User Request: The browser sends a request to www.foobar.com.
DNS Resolution: DNS resolves www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8.
Web Server (Nginx): Receives the request and determines whether it can serve static files or pass the request to the application server.
Application Server: Executes the application logic using the codebase.
Database: Provides any required data to the application server.
Response: The web server sends the final response (HTML page) back to the user's browser using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

5. Issues with This Infrastructure

Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
If the single server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.
Downtime During Maintenance
Restarting the web or application server (e.g., for deploying new code) results in temporary unavailability.
Scalability
A single server cannot handle large amounts of traffic effectively. Once resource limits (CPU, RAM, etc.) are reached, users will experience slowdowns or failures.
